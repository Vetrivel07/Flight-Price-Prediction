# Flight Price Prediction

The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust model that leverages historical data to accurately forecast flight prices. This model aims to enable passengers to make informed decisions about when to book their flights, ultimately optimizing their travel costs. Additionally, the model will provide airlines with valuable intelligence to inform their pricing strategies, promoting data-driven decision-making within the aviationÂ industry.

## Tasks Performed

- Importing necessary libraries for data manipulation.
- Loading training and test datasets into pandas dataframes.
- Merging datasets for comprehensive analysis.
- Cleaning and transforming data to remove missing values and irrelevant columns.
- Encoding categorical variables into numerical representations for modeling.
- Visualizing key insights and trends through various graphs.

## Data Source

The project utilizes flight-related data obtained from [Kaggle](). The dataset includes essential details such as flight prices, airlines, departure and arrival times, and other relevant information. The dataset is split into a training set and a test set, allowing the model to undergo training on the former and be subsequently evaluated on the latter.
